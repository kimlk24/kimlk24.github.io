# What?

* Cardinal is a pick and place robot to sort packages
* A percentage of packages Cardinal sorts through are put in an exception cart to be manually sorted
* Adding a temporary automated storage buffer can decrease manual sorting and keep the robot working in heavy loads

# How?

* Used **CAD software** such as **Onshape** to design custom adapters, frames, and assemblies to ensure successful prototyping
* **Rapidly prototyped** custom parts by utilizing **3D printers** and **laser cutters**
* **Programmed** and **wired** stepper motors to create custom conveyor belts using **Arduino**, **python**, and **computer vision** techniques

# Results

* Successfully designed, built, and tes﻿ted programmable conveyor belts to organize packages
* Created a proof of concept to show that a﻿ set of 4 conveyor belts can organize items in a loop
* Presented poster presentation and created a white paper to present to Amazon Robotics

# CAD Model
