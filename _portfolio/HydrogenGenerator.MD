# What?

* Through using the method of electrolysis, convert water into usable hydrogen gas to reduce carbon emissions from road vehicles and improve the fuel efficiency.

# How?

* Created a water based hydrogen generator utilizing electrolysis principals and designed using **Autodesk Fusion 360**.
* Rapidly prototyped and tested hydrogen generator to act as a proof of concept

# Results

* Successfully designed and fabricated a hydrogen generator
* Utilized Fusion 360 to make photorealistic model the generator and presented final results orally and in a written report
