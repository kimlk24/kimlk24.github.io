# Features

* **Print-in-place multi material design** allowing for simple all in one fabrication while taking advantage of 3D printing techniques to add features such as fully enclosed skeleton and TPU handle grips. 
* Capable of picking and placing through hole resistors and being used as a general set of low strength plies. 

# What?

* Most projects today are made from multiple materials. For example, a classic pair of needle nose pliers consist of a metal mechanism with normally a rubberized grip. 
* Print-in-place is a 3D printing technique where the 3D printed part does not require any extra parts and/or assembly after being printed and can immediately be used. For example, this image displays a print in place chainmail mesh which once printed required so manual linking of each chain, but rather is configured in the printing design to be fully ready to use once printed.
* If you have seen recent movies like Spider-man or Iron man, there are fabrication machines depicting the superhero designing a new suit, and having the fabricator make it for them in just a few moments all ready to go. Combining the techniques of print-in-place and multi material printing is one of the closest ways we can achieve the superhero fabricator magic with the use of a 3D printer.
* To have successful multi material prints, the materials which you use should have similar cooling/shrinkage properties, similar surface energy, and similar intermolecular forces to ensure sufficient bonding.
* The goal of this project is to create a print-in-place pliers using PLA and TPU which returns to the open position when not in use.
# How?

* Used **CAD software** such as **Fusion 360** to design a print-in-place pliers using multi material 3D printing.
* Utilized multi material concepts like fully enclosing materials which through normal manufacturing methods are almost impossible to take advantage of layer by layer manufacturing. 

# Results

* Successfully designed and printed a set of print-in-place pliers which could be used right after being made and can effectively pick and place through hole resistors.
