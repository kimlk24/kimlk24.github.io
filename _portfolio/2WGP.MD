# What?

* Design and fabricate an alarm clock actuated water gun to help promote consistent sleep routines
* Rapidly prototype iterations to determine most effective mechanism

# How?

* Designed a 2-axis pan tilt mechanism based on **DFM/A** using **SolidWorks**
* Coded an **Arduino** to integrate stepper motors, servos, LCD screen, speaker, and DC motors

# Results

* Utilized **additive manufacturing** processes such as 3D printing and laser cutting to create physical prototypes of the mechanism integrated with a water gun, light, sounder, and screen.

# Future

* Integrate camera and computer vision to track sleeping faces so that water is inevitable
