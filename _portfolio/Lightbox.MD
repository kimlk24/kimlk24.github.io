# Features

* **Programmable flow rate.** Capable of flow rates as low as 1 uL / min to 10 mL / min and able to switch between two different syringe pump sizes.
* **Affordable bill of materials.** Programmable syringe pumps start at around $375, and this syringe pump has a cost under $150. That makes this syringe pump extremely affordable especially due to the use of 3D printed parts.

# What?

* Syringe pumps are precision instruments used in the medical industry but are often nor programmable and expensive
* The goal of this project is to create a programmable, affordable, and accurate syringe pump

# How?

* Used **CAD software** such as **Fusion 360** to design custom parts to fit stepper motors, bearings, mounting hardware, and various sized syringe pumps
* **Rapidly prototyped** custom parts by utilizing **3D printers**
* **Programmed** and **wired** a stepper motor, LEDs, a switch, power supply, and buttons using an **Arduino** using custom code

# Results

* Successfully designed, built, and tested a programmable syringe pump device capable of flow rates as low as 1 uL / min with high accuracy.
